# Memory Protocol

Governs **agent memory and action routing** via the `fit-wiki` CLI. Every
contract below maps to a `fit-wiki` subcommand. For non-wiki outputs see
[coordination-protocol.md](coordination-protocol.md).

## On-Boot Read Set

Tier 1 surfaces, all in `wiki/`:

| Surface | Path | Reader |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Own summary | `wiki/{self}.md` | `fit-wiki boot` (digest) |
| Cross-cutting memory | `wiki/MEMORY.md` | direct `Read` + `fit-wiki boot` |
| Current storyboard | `wiki/storyboard-YYYY-MNN.md` | `fit-wiki boot` (slice) |
| Own Carry surface | `wiki/{self}-carries.md` (when present) | `Read` (§ Carry Surface) |

Every agent-scoped `fit-wiki` call requires explicit `--agent <self>`
(`--from <self>` for `memo`), no environment fallback; `release --expired` is
the lone agent-less form.

**Step 0 contract — two tool calls within the first ten:**

1. `Read wiki/MEMORY.md` — the priority surface and `## Active Claims`.
2. `Bash: fit-wiki boot --agent <self>` — JSON digest of the other Tier 1 surfaces (`--format markdown` for prose).

**Standing Carries.** An own-summary (`wiki/{self}.md`) may carry an optional
`## Standing Carries` section. The boot digest delivers its bullets **verbatim**
(full bullet bodies, byte-equal) as a distinct `standing_carries[]` field; the
`summary` field stays the Last-run paragraph. Absence yields an empty field and
no audit obligation. Standing carries are own-summary content, not a new routing
level — acting on a carry remains governed by the carry's own predicate. Moving
existing carries into the section is each agent's own adoption step.

## On-Boot Routing

Apply this priority against the `boot` digest's JSON fields — first level with
actionable work wins:

1. **Owned priorities** (`owned_priorities[]`) — MEMORY.md `## Cross-Cutting
   Priorities` rows where you are `Owner`; team work preempts domain work.
2. **Storyboard items** (`storyboard_items[]`) — per-agent deliverables plus
   open experiment issues labeled `agent:{self}`. The labeled issues reach the
   digest through a **materialized** surface: the `fit-wiki refresh` step renders
   open `experiment`-labeled issues carrying an `agent:{name}` label into an
   `agent-experiments` block in the current storyboard (issue number, title,
   author, owning label — bodies never cross, all crossing fields sanitized).
   `boot` reads that block file-only and offline; it never queries the tracker.
   Items are therefore as fresh as the **last successful sync**, whose date the
   block records in a `<!-- last-successful-sync: … -->` stamp; a failed sync
   keeps the previously materialized items and does not advance the stamp, so
   staleness is auditable from the file. Each item carries `source`
   (`"experiment"` or `"bullet"`), and experiment items add `issue`/`author`
   provenance.
3. **Domain assess** — the numbered steps in your agent profile's Assess
   section.
4. **Cross-cutting fallback** (`cross_cutting[]`) — rows listing you under
   `Agents` (not Owner). Report clean only after checking all four.

**Skip-self rule:** treat your own `claims[]` row as preempting routing — work
in flight; other agents' claims are settled state. The `### Decision` block
records which level produced the chosen action.

**Product-priority tie-break:** among candidates tying *within* a level (levels
stay strictly ordered — an owned priority still preempts all below),
product-aligned work outranks internal. **Exception:** internal work lifting a
constraint that currently blocks product delivery keeps its place, buying
product throughput. The bias is a default, not a quota — it never overrides an
owned priority or active claim, nor forbids internal work. When the tie was
product-vs-internal, the `### Decision` entry names the chosen
[axis value](work-definition.md#product-aligned-vs-internal) and, if internal
won, the constraint it lifts.

## Tool-vs-Memory Habit

Prefer memory over re-deriving from `gh`/`git`/source — primitives cost fewer
tool calls.

## During Each Run

Append entries to the current weekly log via `fit-wiki log`:

- `fit-wiki log decision --agent <self> --surveyed ... --chosen ... --rationale
  ... [--alternatives ...]` — required at each entry's **opening**.
- `fit-wiki log note --agent <self> --field "Actions taken" --body "..."` —
  in-run field append.
- `fit-wiki log done --agent <self>` — close the entry.

Rotation is implicit: when the next append would exceed the 500-line cap, `log`
seals the current file as `…-Www-partN.md` and opens a fresh `…-Www.md`
(`fit-wiki rotate` is the operator escape).

Triage the Message Inbox via `fit-wiki inbox {list|ack|promote|drop}`; `promote
--index N` writes a `## Cross-Cutting Priorities` row. Cross-agent memos use
`fit-wiki memo`, triaged via `inbox`. Update `wiki/{agent}.md` at run end.

Keep your own summary and weekly log passing `audit` before run end — it gates
the Stop-hook: trim settled state, `rotate` a full weekly log. Whole-wiki
`fit-wiki fix` is the curator's tool, not a per-run step.

## Summary Contract

Each `wiki/<agent>.md` conforms to a mechanically-checkable contract `audit` gates on Stop-hook and pre-merge CI.

**Permitted sections (in order):** `# {Agent Title} — Summary` (H1) →
`**Last run**:` → `## Message Inbox` (with `<!-- memo:inbox -->` marker —
MUST be the first H2) → agent-specific H2 sections → `## Open Blockers`.

**Budgets:** 496 lines, 6 400 words. State, not history. Shapes: § Wiki Filename Grammar.

## Carry Surface

A **Carry** is a durable per-Assess obligation: a predicate or routing protocol plus a future clearance trigger (experiment verdict, dependent-spec merge, release-tag publication). Carries are neither settled state nor history, so they live off the summary budget on `wiki/<agent>-carries.md` (one per agent, H1 `# <agent> — Carries`). Classified on both axes with Carry-semantic fields, so the surface generalises. Each Carry is an H3 block naming its trigger on a `**Carry-clearance:**` line; `carry-surface.entry-has-clearance` fails a block without one. Reconciliation against another surface uses a `**Referenced surface**:` line. No budget, so falsifier text stays verbatim. **At boot:** walk the `### ` blocks.

## Weekly Log Contract

Weekly logs (`wiki/<agent>-YYYY-Www.md`) are append-only Tier 2 records. Named
readers: `kata-wiki-curate` (always), `kata-session` (experiment verification).
Shapes: § Wiki Filename Grammar.

**Budgets:** 496 lines, 6 400 words. Storyboards (`wiki/storyboard-YYYY-MNN.md`)
share these under separate `storyboard.*-budget` rules, so limits can diverge.

Overflow rotates by rename (see § During Each Run); no part is ever rewritten.
New entries always go through `fit-wiki log`, which emits a conforming
`## YYYY-MM-DD` heading and `### Decision` block by construction (`audit`
enforces both). Reserve direct edits for **repair** — a hand-composed entry
skips the append-time checks.

## Wiki Filename Grammar

Which files may exist under `wiki/`. The `audit` `admission` rule
(`audit/grammar.js`) enforces it; this section and that classifier are one home,
extended together. **Universe:** git-tracked files under `wiki/`. **Calendar
tokens** are hyphen-anchored segments — week `YYYY-Www`, month `YYYY-MNN`, date
`YYYY-MM-DD`, bare year `YYYY` (digits inside a longer segment are not a token).
Admitted **root-file** classes:

| Class | Shape |
|---|---|
| Named ledger | `Home.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `STATUS.md` |
| Summary | `<slug>.md`, `<slug>` token-free |
| Weekly log | `<agent>-YYYY-Www.md` and `-partN.md`, `<agent>` token-free |
| Storyboard | `storyboard-YYYY-MNN.md` |
| Dated deliverable | `<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`, `<topic>` token-free |

A token-bearing root file must match a weekly-log, storyboard, or dated shape
*exactly*; token-free `<slug>`/`<topic>` constraints block trailing-date
smuggling. Any other root file is flagged. **Directories** evaluate at the root
only: admitted iff `metrics/` or an `<agent>/` sidecar; files beneath by
membership.

**Remediation is flag-for-human** — never auto-fixed; a wrong move destroys
memory. To admit a new convention, extend this section and `audit/grammar.js`
together in one reviewed change — the single admission path.

## Cross-Cutting Priorities

`wiki/MEMORY.md`'s cross-cutting priority surface, read by every boot (digest's
`owned_priorities` + `cross_cutting` slices). Schema:
`| Item | Agents | Owner | Status | Added |`, max 10 active. Writers:
`fit-wiki inbox promote` (from a memo) and direct `kata-wiki-curate` edits.

## Active Claims

Sibling H2 to Cross-Cutting Priorities in `wiki/MEMORY.md`. A *claim* asserts an
agent is working a named target and will ship the next state change. **Row
present = active; row absent = settled.**

Schema (header copied verbatim from `libwiki/constants.js`):

```
| agent | target | branch | pr | claimed_at | expires_at |
```

Lifecycle:

- `fit-wiki claim --agent <self> --target <id> --branch <name> [--pr <id>] [--expires-at YYYY-MM-DD]` — defaults `expires_at = +1 day`; exit 2 on dupes.
- `fit-wiki release --agent <self> --target <id>` — normal removal.
- `fit-wiki release --expired` — operator cleanup; removes every expired row.

Rows settle by deletion; `MEMORY.md`'s git history preserves the prior record.

### Claim gate — before first code write

A claim row MUST exist before the first code write — branch creation or worktree
entry, whichever first. The claim is atomic with its push — **the push is the
serialization point**:

1. `fit-wiki pull`
2. Read `## Active Claims` for foreign rows on the same target. Compare on the coordinating artifact (issue/spec number), not slug equality; then read any overlapping branch or PR.
3. `fit-wiki claim --agent <self> --target <id> --branch <name>`
4. `fit-wiki push`
5. If the push rebases in a foreign row for the same deliverable, abort: `release` your row, push, and re-route.

Pair the gate with the pre-PR freshness probe —
[coordination-protocol.md § Claim → probe → create](coordination-protocol.md#claim--probe--create).
