  Stand up a new Monorepo-standard repository end to end — bootstrap the
  skeleton, install the skill packs, run coaligned-setup then kata-setup, and
  fill the seams neither owns (root package.json, directory tree, agent
  profiles, CI, remote creation). Use when creating a Forward Impact-style repo
  from nothing, or when one exists but the cross-cutting wiring is missing.

# monorepo-setup

Orchestrate a full repository bootstrap to the three standards: structure
([Monorepo](https://www.monorepo.team/)),
instruction architecture (via the `coaligned-setup` skill), and the agent team
(via the `kata-setup` skill).

This skill owns only the **seams** — the order of operations and the artifacts
the two setup skills assume but never create. It does not restate their
procedures: when a sub-skill changes, follow it; this skill stays put. Run it
once per repository.

## Procedure

<read_do_checklist goal="Confirm the ground before touching the repo">

- [ ] `gh auth status` shows access to the target owner; `apm` is on PATH.
- [ ] The target repo does not exist yet (`gh repo view <owner>/<name>`).
- [ ] Decide name, visibility, and timezone before generating anything.

</read_do_checklist>

### Step 1 — Bootstrap the skeleton

`git init`, default branch `main`, then the seam files from
[references/repo-skeleton.md](references/repo-skeleton.md): `.gitignore` and the
[Monorepo standard][monorepo] top-level directories, each with a `README.md`
naming its jobs. See [the Monorepo standard][monorepo] for what each directory
is for — do not invent structure. Commit.

### Step 2 — Add the root package.json

Create the root manifest from [references/repo-skeleton.md]. This is the seam
`coaligned-setup` assumes: it wires `npx coaligned` into the check task but
never creates the manifest. The `coaligned` bin ships only inside
`@forwardimpact/libcoaligned` (no bare launcher), so add it as a devDependency,
pinned to a release whose budgets exempt YAML frontmatter (0.1.15+) — otherwise
the published skill packs breach the instruction caps.

### Step 3 — Install the skill packs

```sh
apm install forwardimpact/coaligned-skills forwardimpact/kata-skills --target claude
```

Both sub-skills assume their packs sit in `.claude/skills/`. APM integrates
skills only — confirm the kata **agent profiles** also landed in
`.claude/agents/`. If missing, copy them from the kata-skills repo
(`agents/*.agent.md` → `.claude/agents/<name>.md`, with `agents/references/`).

### Step 4 — Run coaligned-setup, then kata-setup

Run the `coaligned-setup` skill to completion, then the `kata-setup` skill.
Order matters: the root identity files exist before the agent team references
them. Each skill owns its domain end to end — follow them, do not duplicate
their steps here. Answer their configuration prompts with the choices from the
entry checklist.

### Step 5 — Add the check CI

`coaligned-setup` wires `coaligned` into the check task; add the check workflows
that run on push and pull request — separate from the agent workflows
`kata-setup` generates. One workflow per concern, never a single `check.yml`: at
minimum `check-quality.yml`, `check-test.yml`, and `check-context.yml`. SHA-pin
every action. Templates in [references/check-workflows.md].

### Step 6 — Create the remote, then seed and initialize the wiki

`gh repo create <owner>/<name> --source=. --push` at the chosen visibility, then
enable the wiki and **pre-engage the killswitch** (`gh variable set
KATA_KILLSWITCH --body 1`) so the agent workflows stay dormant until the
operator finishes `kata-setup`'s App and secret steps. Those credential-bound
steps cannot run from here — record them in an operator runbook (`SETUP.md`).

Then stand up the agent team's memory: add the `.claude/settings.json` wiki
hooks, `fit-wiki init` the wiki, seed the three named ledgers (`Home.md`,
`MEMORY.md`, `STATUS.md`) empty-but-scaffolded, and `fit-wiki push`. Full
sequence in [references/wiki-init.md].

### Step 7 — Verify the composition

Run the check task: `coaligned` passes clean with the vendored packs and agent
profiles present. Confirm `gh workflow list` shows the generated workflows, and
that the wiki clones with its three ledgers via `fit-wiki pull`.

## Done When

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Verify the repo stands before handing off">

- [ ] Git, the root `package.json`, and the Monorepo directory tree exist.
- [ ] Both skill packs and the kata agent profiles are under `.claude/`.
- [ ] `coaligned-setup` and `kata-setup` both completed.
- [ ] The check workflows exist (`check-quality`, `check-test`, `check-context`)
      and `coaligned` runs clean.
- [ ] The remote exists, the wiki is on, and `KATA_KILLSWITCH` is engaged.
- [ ] `.claude/settings.json` drives the wiki lifecycle, and the wiki holds
      `Home.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `STATUS.md`.
- [ ] `SETUP.md` lists the operator's remaining credential steps.
